#  Münchhausen Numbers
What we have here is a simple multiplatform Apple app where it demonstrates the use of a Rust library I've build previously. The app shows the executions time of computing [Münchhausen Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_digit-to-digit_invariant) using either [Swift language](https://www.swift.org) or [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org).
