#  Münchhausen Numbers
What we have here is a simple multiplatform Apple app where it demonstrates the use of a [Rust library](https://github.com/KennethYoel/rust-lib-in-swift) I've built previously. The app compares the executions time of computing [Münchhausen Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_digit-to-digit_invariant) using either [Swift language](https://www.swift.org) or [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org).
If there is a need to know how to add the Swift package [SwiftOxide](https://github.com/KennethYoel/SwiftOxide) used in this app, read the aptly name article [Rust Library in Swift](https://medium.com/@kennethyoel/a-swiftly-oxidizing-tutorial-44b86e8d84f5).
